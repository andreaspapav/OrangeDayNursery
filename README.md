<img src="/img/logo.png">

Nowadays, the children get distracted easily and are difficult to control when they are being
taught. In order to keep their attention and have fun at the same time when teaching them,
the client, who leads the Orange Nursery Day, came up with the idea of introducing this
application. Our goal of this project was to implement a web-application based on voice
recognition that is user-friendly and make the childrenâ€™s learning experience challenging and
prepare them as best as possible for school.
We started by designing the website interface and set up the voice recognition. For the
actual implementation we used a combination of frontal-end technologies such as: HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, jQuery- frameworks built on these technologies to make
coding the application a lot easier. Moreover, as a back-end technology we used PHP and
we hosted the web-application on Microsoft Azure.
As a result of all our work, we finished the web-application and managed to implement
all of the features we agreed with our client and added extra ones.
